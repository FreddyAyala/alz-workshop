**M**easurable - Quantifiable outcomes  
**A**ctionable - Concrete steps and implementations  
**R**elevant - Context-appropriate suggestions  
**T**ime-bound - Consider deployment timelines and constraints  

### Advanced Prompt Patterns

#### 1. Constraint-Based Prompting

```terraform
# SMART Prompt Example:
# SPECIFIC: Create Azure Container Apps environment for microservices architecture
# MEASURABLE: Support 50+ concurrent containers, handle 10,000 RPS
# ACTIONABLE: Include auto-scaling, health checks, and blue-green deployment support
# RELEVANT: PCI-DSS compliant environment for payment processing
# TIME-BOUND: Must deploy within 30-day compliance audit window
#
# Additional Constraints:
# - Budget: Maximum $2000/month operational cost
# - Region: Must use East US for data residency
# - Security: Zero-trust networking, encryption at rest/transit
# - Performance: <100ms p95 latency, 99.9% availability
# - Integration: Must connect to existing Azure AD and Key Vault

resource "azurerm_container_app_environment" "payments" {
  # AI generates with all constraints considered
}
```

#### 2. Architecture-First Prompting

```terraform
# Architecture-First Approach:
# Define the complete architecture before implementation
#
# Business Context: Global e-commerce platform
# Architecture Pattern: Microservices with event-driven communication
# Scale Requirements: Handle Black Friday traffic (10x normal load)
#
# Services Architecture:
# ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
# │   User Service  │    │  Order Service  │    │Product Service  │
# │   (CRUD users)  │    │ (Process orders)│    │ (Catalog mgmt)  │
# └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
#           │                        │                        │
# ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
# │   Payment Svc   │    │ Inventory Svc   │    │ Analytics Svc   │
# │ (Process pymts) │    │ (Stock mgmt)    │    │  (Reporting)    │
# └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
#
# Communication: Service Bus for async messaging, API Management for sync
# Data: Cosmos DB (product catalog), SQL (transactions), Redis (cache)
# Security: Azure AD B2C for customers, managed identities for services
#
# Generate the complete infrastructure for this microservices architecture:

# [AI generates comprehensive microservices infrastructure]
```

#### 3. Problem-Solution Prompting

```terraform
# Problem-Solution Pattern:
# Problem: Existing monolithic application causing deployment bottlenecks
# Current State: Single VM running all components, manual deployment process
# Pain Points: Long deployment times, frequent downtime, scaling limitations
# 
# Desired Solution: Containerized microservices with automated CI/CD
# Requirements: Zero-downtime deployments, independent service scaling
# Success Metrics: Deploy frequency from weekly to daily, downtime <1 hour/month
#
# Migration Strategy: Strangler Fig pattern - gradually replace components
# Timeline: Phase 1 (User Service), Phase 2 (Order Service), Phase 3 (Payment)
#
# Generate Phase 1 infrastructure: Extract User Service to Container Apps
# Include: Database migration, API gateway routing, monitoring setup

# [AI generates migration-appropriate infrastructure]
```

#### 4. Compliance-Driven Prompting

```terraform
# Compliance-Driven Infrastructure Generation:
# 
# Regulatory Framework: HIPAA (Healthcare data) + SOC 2 Type II
# Data Classification: PHI (Protected Health Information)
# Geographic Restrictions: US-only data residency, no cross-border transfer
# 
# HIPAA Requirements Implementation:
# - Encryption: AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
# - Access Control: Role-based access, principle of least privilege
# - Audit Logging: All data access logged and monitored
# - Data Backup: Encrypted backups with 7-year retention
# - Network Security: Private endpoints only, no public internet access
# 
# SOC 2 Controls:
# - Security: Multi-factor authentication, vulnerability management
# - Availability: 99.9% uptime SLA, disaster recovery procedures
# - Processing Integrity: Data validation, error handling
# - Confidentiality: Data loss prevention, encryption key management
# - Privacy: Data anonymization, consent management
#
# Generate HIPAA/SOC2 compliant infrastructure for patient management system:

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "healthcare_compliant" {
  # AI generates with full compliance considerations
}
```
