## Understanding Copilot Context

### How Copilot Reads Your Code

Copilot considers multiple sources of context:

1. **Current File Content**
   - Code above and around cursor
   - Comments and documentation
   - Variable and function names

2. **Open Tabs**
   - Related files in your workspace
   - Configuration files
   - Documentation files

3. **Workspace Structure**
   - Project organization
   - File naming conventions
   - Directory structure

4. **Git Repository**
   - Commit messages
   - Branch names
   - Recent changes

### Context Optimization Techniques

**Better Context = Better Suggestions**

**❌ Poor Context**:
```terraform
# Create storage
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "
```

**✅ Rich Context**:
```terraform
# Project: E-commerce Platform
# Environment: Production
# Purpose: Secure storage for customer data and application assets

# Create production storage account with geo-redundancy and security features
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "customer_data" {
  # Copilot now understands: production, security, geo-redundancy, customer data
```

---

## Basic Copilot Interactions

### 1. Code Completion

**Trigger**: Start typing code or functions

```terraform
# Type: resource "azurerm_
# Copilot suggests various Azure resources

resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "main" {
  # Type: name = "
  # Copilot suggests: name = "vnet-main"
  
  # Type: location = 
  # Copilot suggests: location = "East US"
```

### 2. Comment-to-Code Generation

**Trigger**: Write descriptive comments

```terraform
# Create a production-ready web application infrastructure
# Including load balancer, app service, and database
# With proper security and monitoring configured

# Copilot generates complete infrastructure based on comment
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "main" {
  name     = "rg-webapp-prod"
  location = "East US"
}

resource "azurerm_application_gateway" "main" {
  # ... detailed configuration
}

resource "azurerm_app_service_plan" "main" {
  # ... appropriate settings
}
```

### 3. Pattern Recognition

**Trigger**: Establish patterns in your code

```terraform
# First resource establishes pattern
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "dev" {
  name                     = "stwebappdev"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.dev.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.dev.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}

# Start typing second resource
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "staging" {
  # Copilot recognizes pattern and suggests similar configuration
  name                     = "stwebappstaging"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.staging.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.staging.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "GRS"  # Adjusted for staging environment
}
```
