## AI Interaction Best Practices

### Effective AI Conversation Techniques
```
1. START WITH CONTEXT
"I'm working on [project type] for [industry/company size]. 
The main business goal is [objective].
Current constraints are [technical, budget, timeline].
My experience level with [technology] is [beginner/intermediate/advanced]."

2. BE SPECIFIC WITH REQUIREMENTS  
Instead of: "Create a web application infrastructure"
Use: "Create infrastructure for Node.js e-commerce web application with PostgreSQL database, Redis caching, supporting 10,000 concurrent users with 99.9% availability SLA"

3. REQUEST EXPLANATIONS
"Explain why you chose Azure App Service over Container Apps for this scenario"
"What are the trade-offs between these database options?"
"How does this configuration address the security requirements?"

4. ITERATE AND REFINE
"The previous suggestion works, but I need to optimize for cost. Can you modify to reduce monthly spending by 30%?"
"Add disaster recovery capabilities with RTO of 4 hours"
"Enhance security to meet SOC 2 Type II requirements"

5. VALIDATE AND QUESTION
"Review this configuration for security vulnerabilities"
"Are there any Azure Well-Architected Framework principles I'm missing?"
"What would happen if [specific component] fails?"
```
