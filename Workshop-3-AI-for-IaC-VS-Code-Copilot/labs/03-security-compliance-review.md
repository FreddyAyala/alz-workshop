resource "azurerm_resource_group" "app" {
  name     = "rg-webapp-prod"
  location = "East US"
  
  tags = {
    Environment = "Production"
  }
}

  # Problematic settings - identify the security issues
  allow_nested_items_to_be_public = true
  shared_access_key_enabled       = true
  public_network_access_enabled   = true
  https_traffic_only_enabled      = false
  min_tls_version                 = "TLS1_0"
  
  # Missing network rules - security gap
  
  tags = azurerm_resource_group.app.tags
}

  start_ip_address = "0.0.0.0"
  end_ip_address   = "255.255.255.255"  # Too permissive!
}

resource "azurerm_linux_web_app" "app" {
  name                = "webapp-prod-2024"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.app.name
  location           = azurerm_service_plan.app.location
  service_plan_id    = azurerm_service_plan.app.id
  
  site_config {
    always_on = true
    
    # Missing security configurations
    # - No HTTPS enforcement
    # - No minimum TLS version
    # - No security headers
  }
  
  app_settings = {
    # Hardcoded sensitive values - security issue!
    DATABASE_PASSWORD = "P@ssw0rd123!"

  os_type            = "Linux"
  sku_name           = "P1v3"
}
```

## Part 2: Automated Security Scanning

### Step 1: Set Up Security Scanning Tools

**Install security scanning tools**:

```bash
# Install tfsec (Terraform security scanner)
# Windows (using Chocolatey):
choco install tfsec

# macOS (using Homebrew):
brew install tfsec

# Linux or direct download:
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/tfsec/master/scripts/install_linux.sh | bash

# Install Checkov (multi-cloud security scanner)
pip install checkov

# Verify installations
tfsec --version
checkov --version
```

**Run the security scans directly**:

```bash
# Create a directory for results
mkdir -p security-scan-results

# Run tfsec and output to JSON and a readable report
echo "Running tfsec scan..."
tfsec . --format json --out security-scan-results/tfsec-results.json
tfsec . --format lovely --out security-scan-results/tfsec-report.txt

# Run Checkov and output to JSON and a readable report
echo "Running Checkov scan..."
checkov -d . --framework terraform --output json --output-file-path security-scan-results/checkov-results.json
checkov -d . --framework terraform --output cli --output-file-path security-scan-results/checkov-report.txt

echo "Security scan complete. Results are in the security-scan-results/ directory"
```

### Step 2: Analyze Scanning Results

**Review scan results**:
```bash
# View tfsec results summary
cat security-scan-results/tfsec-report.txt

# View Checkov results
cat security-scan-results/checkov-report.txt

# You can manually inspect the JSON files for more details
# For example, using the VS Code search function to find "CRITICAL" or "HIGH"
```

**Create findings analysis** `security-findings-analysis.md`:

```markdown
# Security Findings Analysis

## Automated Scan Results

### High-Severity Issues (Immediate Action Required)

#### Finding 1: Hardcoded Credentials
- **Tool**: tfsec/Checkov
- **Rule**: CKV_AZURE_109, AWS004
- **Description**: Database password hardcoded in configuration
- **Impact**: Credential exposure, unauthorized access risk
- **Remediation**: Use Azure Key Vault and managed identities

#### Finding 2: Public Storage Access
- **Tool**: tfsec
- **Rule**: AZU003
- **Description**: Storage account allows public blob access
- **Impact**: Data exposure, potential data breach
- **Remediation**: Disable public access, implement private endpoints

### Medium-Severity Issues (Address Soon)

#### Finding 3: Weak TLS Configuration
- **Tool**: Checkov
- **Rule**: CKV_AZURE_44
- **Description**: Minimum TLS version set to 1.0
- **Impact**: Weak encryption, compliance violation
- **Remediation**: Enforce TLS 1.2 minimum

### Compliance Violations

#### SOC 2 Compliance Issues
- [ ] Public data access enabled
- [ ] Weak access controls
- [ ] Insufficient audit logging

#### PCI DSS Compliance Issues
- [ ] Hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Public network access to databases
- [ ] Weak encryption settings

## Remediation Priority Matrix

| Finding | Severity | Effort | Priority |
|---------|----------|---------|----------|
| Hardcoded credentials | High | Low | P1 |
| Public storage access | High | Medium | P1 |
| Open firewall rules | High | Low | P1 |
| Weak TLS settings | Medium | Low | P2 |
| Missing audit logs | Medium | Medium | P2 |

### Step 2: Validate Security Remediation

**Run security scan on secure configuration**:
```bash
# Scan the secure configuration
tfsec secure-config.tf --format lovely

# Compare with original vulnerable configuration
echo "=== Vulnerable Configuration Issues ==="
tfsec vulnerable-config.tf --format json | jq '.results | length'

echo "=== Secure Configuration Issues ==="
tfsec secure-config.tf --format json | jq '.results | length'

echo "=== Issues Resolved ==="
echo "Should show significant reduction in security issues"
```

**Create security validation report** `security-validation-report.md`:

```markdown
